## gpu_test.py
> This script runs the MNIST Digits test. This is a good, quick check to see if everything is set up correctly. If you are using a GPU enabled environment, it should complete in 15-20s or less.

## hello_world.py
> Test to see if python is running at all.

## multiclass_images.py
> Gets all the images from the directory structure. The script version of Multiclass_Image_Processing.ipynb.

## multiclass_model.py
> Script version of Multiclass_Model.ipynb

## README.md
